## Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from the idea of creating ai-generated, rockstar NFTs. Since that idea wasn't sustainable for the expertise that we possessed, we did the next best thing. We made an app where users can assemble their **favorite band** from a collection of **ai-generated, rockstar avatars.**

## What it does
Users have the opportunity to answer questions related to their favorite songs and spend their Rockstar Coins on Rockstar Packs of varying rarity. More expensive packs have a better chance of giving the user cards of higher rarity. Once the user collects enough musicians, they can assemble a **band of the best!** 

## How we built it
We spent the majority of our time developing the app in Xcode while occasionally utilizing Cursor to break through some walls. We had one person who was our main developer and the two others handled crucial design and functionality tasks.

## Challenges we ran into
While attempting to access some APIs, we realized that the API either didn't have the data we needed or that we were trying to access features through deprecated methods. There were _many_ times when we went back to the drawing board.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is our **first** hackathon, not just as a team, but as three individuals that have **never competed in a hackathon** until now. We began the first night of the hackathon lost and a little intimidated, we didn't think we'd even have a project to submit. But writing this now, we're proud to say that we completed our very first hackathon and didn't earn a DNF.

## What we learned
We learned that no matter how lost we may seem on day 1, there is still an opportunity to pull through for day 2. We're really excited to experience the final ceremony, just to see what kind of competition we were up against.

## What's next for Rockstar Band Builder
As of right now, probably retirement. But, maybe one day there will come a time when we need a code snippet from it for another project we're working on.
